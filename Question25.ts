// Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a
//  variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow',
//  or 'red'.
//• Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it
//  is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.

// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another 
// that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
